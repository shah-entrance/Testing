# Testing
***To test the solution during contest by comparing optimized and brute force solution.

How to test your solution whether it works correctly or not:
  1. Place your brute force code into brute.cpp and your optimized one into sol.cpp
  2. Now write the generator code in gen.cpp which varies according to the question.
  3. Run the test.bat file.

***Don't forget to place all these three files in same directory.   
***If your code faily on any test case then immediately input.txt opens which contains the test case on your logic failed.

Thank You  
Happy Coding.
